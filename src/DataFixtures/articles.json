    Gone are the days of the design mindset when kitchens were tucked away and used only for 
    prepping food. Today, they\’re an extension of living areas. Homebuyers want beautiful 
    open spaces and expansive islands for effortless and elegant gathering. In the following 
    homes\, represented by Allie Beth Allman & Associates, the kitchens will bring you joy this
     holiday season. The recently updated home at 104 Keystone Drive in Southlake’s Estes Park
      community is offered by Dona Robinson.The kitchen has a large island and new appliances 
      and connects to a double-height great room. This provides a seamless flow for large-scale 
      entertaining.Closer to Dallas’ center is the stone residence at 7130 Brookcove Lane, 
      offered by Jean Bateman. The 7\,648-square-foot home includes a rustic kitchen that
       blends stone and wood and opens to a spacious living area and wet bar. The kitchen
        includes a separate baker’s cupboard.",
